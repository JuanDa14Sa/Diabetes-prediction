# Diabetes Prediction App

This repository contains code for building a ML model to predict diabetes. The model is integrated into a Streamlit web application for easy deployment and predictions. Additionally, a Jupyter notebook is provided to explore the dataset and implement improvements to the model.

- **Dataset:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set]
- **Web app:** [https://diabetes-prediction-rf.streamlit.app]

## Files in the Repository

1. **diabetes_prediction.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the data exploration and model development process. It includes steps such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

2. **app.py**: This is the main file for the Streamlit web application. It loads the trained model and allows users to input their own data for prediction.

3. **requirements.txt**: This file lists all the Python packages and their versions required to run the app. Use the following command to install them:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

Happy predicting!
